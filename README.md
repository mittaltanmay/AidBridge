The Main Idea behind This Project is to help Refugee by providing them resources in the time of need with location based system for ease and also connecting them with NGO that are willing to provide them help for the aids and hosting events for them.

 Features
✅ User Authentication – Secure login for Refugees, NGOs, and Admins
✅ Profile Management – Users can update personal details and preferences
✅ Aid Request & Distribution – Refugees can request aid, and NGOs can allocate resources
✅ Location-Based Assistance – Displays nearby refugee camps and support centers
✅ Announcements & Notices – NGOs can post important updates

The app digitizes refugee registration & profiles, streamlines resource allocation, allows communication between refugees, sends notifications & updates to refugees, and acts as a bridge between those who needs help and those who wants to help.
Our App will also be taking care of clustering of refugee in one place and also streamlining their participation in events.
